About Brian Barczyk:
Hi! I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals. My journey here on YouTube and social media has been truly magnificent and magical. Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. 

In March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer. Despite the challenges and my fears, the amazing community we've built on YouTube over the last 7+ years has kept me inspired to continue sharing my journey.

Now, I'm fully committed to building our expanded facility, Legasea Aquarium & The Reptarium, just across the street. This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.

Join us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope. Together, we'll make a lasting impact and celebrate the extraordinary animal world.",2024-01-07T13:59:45Z,300166

17,I Released an Apex Predator into My Giant Rainforest Vivarium,"I created my dream tank, a 1000 gallon cloud rainforest vivarium, called Pantdora, and it's purpose is to study how tropical ants and other exotic creatures live in the wild. I already added an initial team of animals into the terrarium, but it was missing a very important player in the food chain: an apex predator. In this episode, we release my chosen apex predator into the Pantdoran rainforest, and the result was pretty awesome. Hope you enjoy this week's episode, Part 7 of my Ecosystem Vivarium Series. Ant love forever! This video was shot in 4K Ultra HD resolution.

_________________________________

Traveling through China isn’t something we ever thought we would do.  It’s a controversial country to many people, especially Americans.  And it’s not an easy country to get into (the visa process is long).

Because we are building a boat with HH Catamarans, and their main factory is here…we were able to get business visas.  And we have been ALL business with our trips (turns out managing a new boat build is a full-time job).

Thankfully, our boat is on the final stretch and sea trials begin soon.  Which means we will be ready to sail out of here before the end of the month!

But we are in China!  A country we never thought we would have the opportunity to see, much less experience.  There’s no way we could let ourselves sail out of here without exploring at least a little bit of the country first.  So, we decided to take a one-week hiatus from the factory and do exactly that.

China is a huge country with some of the most incredible landscapes we’ve never seen.  Luckily, China has the biggest highspeed railway network in the world.  So, we decided to pick a direction and go as far as we could.  A 2100km journey from Xiamen to the start of the Tibet Mountains in the Yunnan Province.

And let me tell you, China isn’t at all what we expected.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WE’RE JASON AND NIKKI WYNN.  A couple of modern-day documentarians, perpetual travelers, and seekers of tall tales.  

We’ve been chasing our curiosity around the world on wheels and keels since 2011. Why?  Because curiosity is the key to unlocking life.  It pushes us outside our comfort zone, softens our assumptions, and helps us embrace the great unknown.  The more we let our curiosity lead the way, the more we discover about ourselves and the world around us.

Our home is also our transportation and we spend weeks away from civilization and sometimes land.  Self-reliance and living a sustainable lifestyle are a must.  It's all about managing our resources and we’re always looking for new and better ways to do so.  

We've lived off the grid for over 10 years now in everything from a Van to RV to a Sailboat. And over time we have learned a lot about renewable energy, creating safe drinking water, and managing our waste.

Our journey is ever-evolving but the mission remains the same: #CultivateCuriosity

About Brian Barczyk:
Hi! I'm Brian Barczyk, and I have been daily vlogging on YouTube since May 10, 2016 sharing my amazing life filled with animals. My journey here on YouTube and social media has been truly magnificent and magical. Since 2016, I've been part of TV network series, produced my own documentary in South Africa, traveled the world to meet incredible animals and animal lovers, started a podcast, created a convention for animal content creators, built and expanded The Reptarium - an interactive reptile Zoo in Utica, Michigan and so much more. 

In March 2023, just as we were ready to break ground on our expanded facility, I received a life-altering diagnosis of inoperable Pancreatic Cancer. Despite the challenges and my fears, the amazing community we've built on YouTube over the last 7+ years has kept me inspired to continue sharing my journey.

Now, I'm fully committed to building our expanded facility, Legasea Aquarium & The Reptarium, just across the street. This project represents resilience and the pursuit of dreams in difficult times. With the incredible support of our community, the #ReptileArmy, we're turning obstacles into opportunities. Together, let's create a brighter future for reptiles and all animals, inspiring others to embrace their passions in the face of adversity.

Join us on this inspiring journey of discovery, conservation, and hope. Together, we'll make a lasting impact and celebrate the extraordinary animal world.",2024-01-06T13:59:46Z,371807

The Nightmare of Alaska Airlines flight 2059,"If you're struggling or just want to improve, consider therapy with our sponsor BetterHelp 👉🏻 https://betterhelp.com/mentourpilot for a 10% discount on your first month of therapy with a licensed professional, specific to your needs. 

If you are in need of urgent help, please use this link and find your country 👉🏻 https://findahelpline.com/ 

Imagine being a pilot, sitting in the cockpit of an airliner at 31 000 feet when suddenly, a colleague you are giving a ride to, surges forward and starts trying to shut down your aircrafts engines! This is exactly what happened to Alaska Airlines flight 2059 and the reason behind it, is what this video is all about. I want to take this time to say that this is an issue that sits very close to my heart and I hope this video will be used to show that ANYONE is susceptible to mental health issues and might require help. We must all work together to fight the stigma surrounding mental health and work towards a safer and more inclusive mental environment, in aviation but also in other sectors. //Petter

42,3 Year Timelapse: Building A Hotel In A Ghost Town,"Hello there! This is a video I dreamed of for a very long time. The American Hotel has risen from the ashes and is now framed in. 

Losing the original hotel was one of the most devastating days of my life and made me question the entire project, my life's path, and more. But thanks in big part to the support of this channel, we are seeing the American Hotel stand once again. 

Thank you all so, so, much for all the support over the years. 2024 is going to be the best year yet at Cerro Gordo, and I can't wait to share it with you all!

Special thanks to each and every volunteer who came up here over the past few years and put work into this place. This wouldn't have happened without you. 

Another special THANK YOU to Kyle and Andrew at Southern Sierra Framing. They did amazing wood work raising this thing. 

My time up here has taught me so much and I have another very exciting announcement to make - 

I wrote a book! I have been working on this for almost two years now and I am SO excited to finally announce it. I put my put my heart and soul into this thing and really dug deep on making sense of these past 3+ years living up here. The book has all sorts of new stories, insights, and history of the town. I think it’s the best content I’ve ever made.

If you've ever got anything out of this channel, I hope you'll consider pre-ordering the book. It is a HUGE way to show support for everything going on and would mean the world to me.

In this video, I made 100 villagers survive Five Nights at Freddy's 2. Every night the villagers spend at Freddy's Brand New Pizzeria, the animatronics become more aggressive and dangerous. With the new pizzeria, comes with many new animatronics such as Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, Toy Chica, and many more. In order to survive all Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the villagers will have to watch the hallway, cameras, vents, Marionette's music box, and much more. It's up to the group of 100 villagers to survive all Five Nights at Freddy's 2 until the very end of the video. This challenge is similar to the content of Grox, Sword4000, and SpeedSilver

Bilateral symmetry is an unspoken assumption in aircraft design. Anything in nature that flies, from the smallest insect to the largest bird, possesses symmetry. But birds don't fly supersonic. 

In the 1950’s Robert Thomas Jones, a brilliant NASA engineer, began developing a radical new wing arrangement called an oblique wing (also referred to as a skewed wing). The wing design was characterized by a wing that could pivot into a unique angled configuration in relation to the aircraft’s fuselage. The design offered several advantages over more conventional swept wings. An oblique wing’s ability to pivot into a straight wing made it ideal for low speed flight (improving efficiency and take-off/landing performance), but at transonic and supersonic speeds, the angled orientation minimized both wave and induced drag, leading to improved overall aerodynamic efficiency. With lower drag at higher speeds, oblique wing aircraft would require less thrust to maintain a given speed, resulting in reduced fuel consumption and operating costs.  Compared to other variable geometry wings, oblique wings would also be lighter, less complex and have fewer drawbacks like a shifting center of lift.

Jones proved his theories through wind tunnel tests and with small scale remote control models. Promising results prompted NASA to undertake more intensive research during the 1970s. The first major step was the propeller-driven Oblique Wing Remotely Piloted Research Aircraft (OWRPRA) which first took flight in 1976. At the same time, aviation leaders Boeing and Lockheed were invited to study oblique wings to assess their benefits to commercial air travel. In 1979 the NASA Ames-Dryden-1 (AD-1), a subsonic, human piloted oblique wing aircraft began rigorous flight testing.

NASA’s research efforts validated many of Jones’s theories, and the oblique wing demonstrated promise in real world flight. There were plans to follow the subsonic AD-1 program with a supersonic testing program using a modified U.S Navy F-8 fighter, but the program was cancelled early on in development. Budget constraints and shifting priorities have largely stalled intensive oblique wing research programs since the early 1990s. There are still widespread reservations about the flying qualities of highly asymmetrical aircraft. Flight control at extreme wing pivots is unfavorable and requires automated systems to augment flight control. Using modern flight control technologies and advanced materials, many of these drawbacks could be overcome. Oblique wings are still considered a viable concept for large transports and many are convinced that they will eventually be adopted. The advantages are simply too great to ignore.

Lyrics:
We are the children of the devolution
The infamous martyrs
The scars on the sun
Asphyxiating with a smile on your face
While they pull your teeth out one by one
 
Is this what you wanted?
NO
Do you want some more?
YES
D-generation
Who’s keeping score?
 
Cos you got a taste now
Drank the Kool-aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, ow
Come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you
Oh my dear
But you should of known
That this was gonna end in tears
 
Such a sucker for an execution 
The void is a vampire
Fat on our blood
Domesticated like a cat in a cage 
While they try their hand at playing god
 
Is this what you wanted?
NO
Do you want some more?
YES
D-generation
Afraid there’s no cure
 
Cos you got a taste now
Drank the Kool-aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, ow
Come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you
Oh my dear
But you should of known
That this was gonna end in tears
 
I got my hands around your throat
I love the way you choke
Cos I am yours and you are mine
I’ll never let you go 
My hands around your throat 
I love the way you choke
Cos I am yours and you are mine
I’ll never let you go 
 
I’ll never let you go 
Get the fuck up
 
Cos you got a taste now
Drank the Kool-aid by the jug
So suffer your fate, ow
Come here and give me a hug
Nobody loves you like I love you
Oh my dear
But you should of known
You should of known
But you should of known
That this was gonna end in tears

78,Nicki Minaj: The 'Pink Friday 2' Interview | Apple Music,"The one and only Nicki Minaj joins Ebro in the studio just days after the release of her record-breaking album, 'Pink Friday 2.'

Nicki shares a bit about what's been going on in her personal life since the release of her last album and how she balances being vulnerable with her fans while also protecting her privacy. Fans have noted that tracks like ""Are You Gone Already"" and ""Last Time i Saw You"" are some of the most personal songs the artist has ever released, and Nicki shares the stories behind them with Ebro.

Nicki also explains how she channeled her mindset during 'Pink Friday' while writing 'Pink Friday 2', her experience working with J. Cole on ""Let Me Calm Down"", and collaborating with Drake on ""Needle"", which, though she always felt belonged on 'Pink Friday 2', was originally created for 'For All the Dogs.' The discussion also touches on the incomparable energy of the Barbz, the media's perception of Nicki, and how being an actor informs her musicality.

With a world tour on the way and new music continuing to drop, it's clear that the album's exciting release week is only the beginning of the 'Pink Friday 2' era.

By the way, even though Overwatch 2 came out in 2022, I wanted to include it since Blizzard announced they'd cut the PVE mode in 2023 and it came out on Steam.

LYRICS

I’m making an offer that you cannot deny
You won’t be laughing when I’m making you cry
’Cause, eh oh
I hear the pleas get louder
You son of a bitch
You’re gonna beg and cower 
 

Vendetta is a friend of mine
Revenge is sweeter than wine
I never asked to hear your God damn feelings
Get on your knees when you’re kissing my ring 
 

Well I can remember all the bad memories 
I never forget a face that’s quite so ugly 
Eh oh
Lost years are wasted
I always liked you but I’m glad that you’re all dead
 

Vendetta is a friend of mine
Revenge is sweeter than wine
I never asked to hear your God damn feelings
Get on your knees when you’re kissing my ring

I’m making an offer that you cannot deny
You won’t be laughing when I’m making you cry
’Cause eh oh
I hear the pleas get louder
You son of a bitch
You’re gonna beg and cower

With a huge following and major blockbusters under his belt, Zack Snyder has seemingly secured a deal with Netflix to kinda do whatever he wants. We saw this come to fruition with Army of the Dead a few years ago and now he’s at it again with kinda Star Wars!


Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire definitely raises some questions. Like is this movie a long montage? Why is everything slow-mo? When you join the squad, are you required to just stand silently in the background? 


To answer all these questions, check out the pitch meeting that led to Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire!

The people that's been in his productions - they're not famous. All of them can walk through the mall without security. Be what you're going to be, but put your people on.""

In this Broadcast Award-winning, BAFTA and Emmy Award-nominated entertainment show, Taskmaster tyrant Greg Davies (Man Down, Cuckoo), with the help of his loyal assistant Alex Horne (The Horne Section and the show’s creator), sets out to test the wiles, wit and wisdom of five hyper-competitive comedians.

Comedians that have risked life, limb, and dignity in the hope of making the Taskmaster proud so far include: Frank Skinner (The Frank Skinner Show), Mel Giedroyc (The Great British Bake Off), Romesh Ranganathan (Asian Provocateur), Hugh Dennis (Outnumbered), Sally Phillips (Bridget Jones’ Diary), Rose Matafeo (Edinburgh Comedy Award Winner 2018), and Russell Howard (The Russell Howard Hour). Unaware of what awaits them in each wax-sealed envelope, only one competitor can become the victorious owner of His Royal Task-ness’ golden head and be crowned the next Taskmaster Champion.",2024-01-03T21:00:11Z,411476
109,BUILDING A MARBLE CLOCK Pt.4 - NOW FASTER!!,"Check out PCBWay here: https://www.pcbway.com/?from=Ivan for a trusted one-stop solution to 3D Printing Services, CNC Machining, Injection Moulding and more!

As I promised in the last video I tried my best to make the clock update minute by minute. It wasn't an easy feat as I dealt with many (expected) issues. As many of you will notice I'm still having lots of issues with the marbles getting stuck on the machine as there's about a 2:5 ratio between good and bad marbles. If anyone knows about a good source of glass marbles please let me know. I had to do a bit of fiddling with the programming to get the timing right and I broke a few more things that what can be seen in the video but at least we have a clock that runs on time now. It is now louder and has less music to it, it is less zen and more stressful but learned a lot here. This project was a lot of fun and I may try some of the things that I could not do in this series in the coming videos. As always loving to hear from you in the comments.

From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic, MEAN GIRLS. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by the conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself prey in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.

156,Michigan stuns Alabama in overtime & Washington survives vs Texas in the College Football Playoff,"FOX Sports’ lead college football analyst Joel Klatt reacts to a wild day in College Football as both Semifinal matchups came down to the final play.  Klatt begins by breaking down the game that he attended at the Rose Bowl as Michigan found a way to come back and take down Alabama in overtime. He explains why this win has been 3 years in the making for the Wolverines and how Michigan possesses the single attribute that has defined National Championship teams in recent years. He then discusses Washington’s thrilling win over Texas that nearly resulted in a stunning win for the Longhorns.  Klatt discusses the crazy ending and what he believes made the difference in the game. He also explains why Michael Penix Jr  deserved more serious Heisman consideration than he got this season and again proved he is the best QB in college football.

It doesn’t mean anything to be Working class or middle class anymore… The only thing that matters is if you own a home or if you don’t.

The home you live in now statistically makes more money than you do and the last  hope that a lot of young people have to catch up is getting a house gifted to them by a relative... which begs the question. What happens to the real estate market when all the boomers… die? 

There is an old saying that the best time to start investing was 30 years ago, the second-best time is right now. But that conventional wisdom might not hold up in today’s market. Buying a home at the right time could set you and family up for financial security for the rest of your life. The only thing is, the right time was when you were still in school and if you try to buy a home now you will be taking on record high interest rates, record high prices AND record low availability all at the same time… People sell homes for two reasons, because they want to and because they HAVE to. Nobody who already has a home WANTS to sell it because most Americans have been able to lock in record low interest rates. If they sell their house and buy another one, they will get a new mortgage at interest rates which will TRIPPLE their payments on a home of the same value. According to data from the national association of realtors, eighty-seven percent [87%] of new home purchases are made using a mortgage, and the average down payment of a first home buyer is only seven percent [7%]. This means higher mortgage rates are worth avoiding at all costs. 

A report by the wall street journal found that even when homeowners moved interstate, they would hold on to their homes and rent them out and then rent another house to live in… Everybody that wants to sell their home is waiting for interest rates to fall. Everybody who wants to buy a home is also waiting for interest rates to fall. And everybody who is stuck renting is being forced to compete with people who already own a home but don’t want to sell it because they have locked in a sweet interest rate. 

The players in the real estate market are in a Mexican standoff, but the renters are stuck fighting with a Banana. The only hope for people who just want to buy a home is to get it off someone who NEEDS to sell. According to another report published by the national association of realtors the average home seller in America was SIXTY!! [60] years old!

So it’s time to learn How Money Works to find out why you probably won’t benefit as much as you are hoping from the boomers passing down their homes…",2024-01-02T18:26:38Z,807856

On January 1st, 2014, I uploaded the first ""Things You Might Not Know"" video. Once the initial rush of videos settled down, I aimed for one video a week, and while there have sometimes been guest videos and occasional blatant filler: to my own satisfaction, I never missed a week. But now, it's time to stop.

I never got to space. I never got to the ocean depths. And I never got to fly off into the sunset, harnessed underneath a helicopter. I couldn't find an excuse for that one.

166,I Lived INSIDE Minecraft For 150 Days,"I Lived Inside Minecraft For 150 Days. This took over two years. Enjoy this blast from the past.

I decided to live inside of Minecraft for 150 days. I couldn't take the headset off. Not to eat, drink, sleep, nothing. I woke up, and went to bed, fully immersed in Minecraft. This was an insane journey. It took me over 2 years to fully edit and put together this video.

After a long 2023 with no uploads, a lot of stress, and me finally moving to America, I'm excited to return to uploading on YouTube! I have so many ideas. This video occupied a big spot in my mind even when I wasn't working on it. There was over 50 hours of footage to go through and edit! I'm very glad I finished it, and extremely proud of how it turned out :)

It was very touching to go through and relive some of these fun memories and moments with friends, years later. Hopefully it's a blast from the past and reminds everyone of 2021, and some of the awesome memories we all made online during lockdown. Check out their channels below:

Song used in intro: @JVKE - ""this is what space feels like""

186,I Added Animals Into My Giant Rainforest Vivarium,"I created my dream tank, a 1000 gallon cloud rainforest vivarium, and constructing it has been quite a journey. It is fully stocked with tropical plants, automated climate control, and even some creatures that managed to sneak in through the terrarium decor. However, the goal of the vivarium experiment was to recreate and study a rainforest ecosystem so to complete the project, I needed to add more animals. Little did I know, doing so would amp up the biological action within the vivarium in a way that I could never have predicted. Hope you enjoy Part 6 of my ecosystem vivarium series. Ant love forever!
